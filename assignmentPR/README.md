Name:   Conversion Functions. 
Description:    The two functions, characteristic() and mantissa(), will break a character array into a         characteristic and a mantissa. The characteristic for the number 2.351 is 2 and the mantissa is 351 over 1,000. The characteristic for the number 0.0125 is 0 and the mantissa is 125 over 10,000. The characteristic for the number -4.0 is -4 and the mantissa is 0 over 10. These values should be stored in the reference parameters c, numerator and denominator. The C string may include leading or trailing spaces, unary plus or minus signs, integers, or real numbers. Your functions must handle all of these cases. If an invalid string is passed in your function will return false. If the passed in string was valid return true.
